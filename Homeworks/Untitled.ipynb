    "(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.\n",
    "Flexible statistical learning method will be expected to perform better. We have a larger sample size, which helps the model learn better. There are a small number of predictors which lessens the risk of overfitting. \n",

    "(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.\n",
    "Inflexible statistical learning method will be expected to perform better. A smaller sample size means there may be a large risk of bias if we use a flexible statistical learning method. The large number of predictors may cause a flexible statistical method to overfit. An inflexible statistical learning method will help avoid these since it could reach a better model faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n",
    "A flexible statistical learning method will be better since it can adapt itself to the non-linear data better than the inflexible method. Inflexible methods will try to warp the observations to its own idea of the model,  for example a best fit linear model. \n",

    "\n",
    "(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(\"), is extremely high.\n",
    "An inflexible statistical learning method will be better. A flexible method would try to incorporate the extra noise/ error terms into its model, and give an inaccurate model. "

    "(a) Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.\n",
